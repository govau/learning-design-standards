## What are learning design standards?

Digital learning design standards set the bar for what makes a good digital specialist. They describe the skills and knowledge you need and suggest ways in which you can learn them. 

You can use the standards to help identify the training you and your team need to develop digital skills, and to help providers respond to your training requests.
